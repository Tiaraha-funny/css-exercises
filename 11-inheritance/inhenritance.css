/* What do we mean by CSS inheritance? What does it affect?

Inhenritance is a typical properties and always from the parent. It also can controle the effect of the properties have no value on an element.
It doesn't affect changes because it follows what the parents's deeds.

    CSS web docs stengthen that exaplanation about it:
    For inherited properties, this reinforces the default behavior, and is only needed to override another rule. For non-inherited properties, this specifies a behavior that typically makes relatively little sense and you may consider using "initial" instead, or "unset" on the all property.

      "Use this CSS reference to browse an alphabetical index of all of the standard CSS properties, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, data types, and at-rules. You can also browse key CSS concepts and a list of selectors organized by type. Also included is a brief DOM-CSS / CSSOM reference."

/* Which properties have values that are inherited by default?

I think all properties can have value that are inherited by default which can have other values: initial, all, unset including inherit.

One item not in the list was "text-decoration" which affects child elements. A few new properties (text-shadow) also affect child elements

/*What is the difference between the currentColor and inherit keywords when used with colour values?
Currentcolor is specify the normal color but the inherit keyword is to keep the form which the parents had.
*/
/*What do the revert, initial, and unset keyword values do?
Revert and initial are used to apply the property value initial which don't follow whatever the effect of the inheritance value, and the unset is an element which is inherited value.

Are there any dangers or unintended side-effects when using inherit as a value? What about the revert, initial and unset properties?
What are the possibilities with using an ancestor or universal selector, combined with the inherit value?
