  /*
1) Name the functions we can use in a transform's value?
It can be everything in the brackets, we can use deg and turn in atransform.

2) Why do we have to use separate functions, in order, and as values, e.g. transform: scale(0.5) rotate(45deg); when we could have had separate properties like: transform-scale: 0.5;, or transform-rotate: 45deg?
We have to use separate function because rotate can override the scale function.

3) Often, we want to move the central pin or axis of the transform away from its default position. What property do we use to set that?
Moving the central pin we can use transform-origin, or translate().

4) Why is it preferable to use transform: translate() rather than position and its associated properties?
It is preferable because the translate() applies to the content areas but the position applies to the whole content.

6) What problems can you run in to when overriding a transform in a more specific selector?
Using pseudo-call is overriding the basse selector because it is more specific, and it applies the default value of the proprty.

7) If we want to go 3D, we need to use another property to set the view over the scene. What is that property? perspective.

8) We can control what the transform uses in its calculations in terms of the box model. What property can we use to adjust this?
To adjust this calculation we need to use transform-box property.
- content-box
- border-box by the default.
- padding-box
- view-box
In term of the box model we use box-sizing and when we use transform, it needs scale uses to resize it.
