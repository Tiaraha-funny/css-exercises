/* What are their default values?

1- table-layout
It applies the table cells, rows and columns.
Auto: by the default
Fixed:set by the width of the table and col or by the width of the row of the cells.

2- border-spacing
Length is the size of the space of the fixe value.

The border-spacing CSS property sets the distance between the borders of adjacent <table> cells. This property applies only when border-collapse is separate.

It may has a fixe value by using one or two lengths

3- border-collapse
Collapse and Separated.

Explanation from MDN:
When cells are collapsed, the border-style value of inset behaves like groove, and outset behaves like ridge.
When cells are separated, the distance between cells is defined by the border-spacing property.

4- caption-side
Top: above the table
Bottom: below of the table
Top-outside: the width and the horizontal align are not bound to the tables's horizontal layout.
Bottom-outside: the width and the horizontal align are not bound to the tables's horizontal layout.
Left: left side of the table
Right: right-side of the table.

(non-standart and global values: right, outside, inherit, initial and unset)

5- empty-cells
Show and Hide values

table-footer-group = tfoot
table-row = tr

/* What other declaration does border-spacing require before it can work effectively?
 It requires border-collapse: separated.

What are the downsides of using the various table* values for display on a set of elements, thereby simulating a table layout on non-table elements?


What is the difference between table-layout: fixed and table-layout: auto?
Fixed: needs to set by the width.
Auto: it is automaticly to form as a table.

Can you use border-spacing and other table-like properties on non-table elements?
No we can not.

What other declaration does empty-cells require before it can work effectively?
It has the same require as border spacing, it needs separated as the value of border-collapse.
