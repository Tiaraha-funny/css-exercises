  Questions
  =======================

  - What is the difference between `opacity` and a `background-color` that is semi-transparent?
  - What is the difference between `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;`?
  - Why would we use `visibility: visible;`?

*/
/* Differenciation:
    - opacity vs background
Opacity can be the whole content with the element, even though the children.
Background-color is specified with the background not including text or image.

   - display: none vs visibility: hidden
Display none is nothing, it removes everything in the element.
Visibillity hidden tells that the content is exist but it is just hidden.

Visibility:hidden- this property will hide the element but it will occupy the space.
Opacity:0- this property is used to make the element transparent.

Visibility: visible is to show that the element box is visible.
