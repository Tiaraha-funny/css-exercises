  Questions
  =======================

  - What is the difference between `opacity` and a `background-color` that is semi-transparent?
  - What is the difference between `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;`?
  - Why would we use `visibility: visible;`?

*/
/* Differenciation:
    - opacity vs background
Opacity can be the whole content with the element.
Background-color is specified with the background not including text or image.

   - display: none vs visibility: hidden
Display none is nothing, it ignores the content what you've write.
Visibillity hidden tells that the content is exist but it is just hidden.

Visibility: visible is to show that the element box is visible.
